Project Title: Advanced Student Management System

Overview:
The Advanced Student Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the management of students in an educational institution. It provides a robust set of features to efficiently handle student data, such as storing student information, managing departments, tracking academic progress, and facilitating communication between students, faculty, and administrators. The system aims to enhance the overall student management process, improve data accuracy, and optimize administrative tasks.

Key Features:
1. Authentication and Authorization: The system ensures secure access to authorized personnel through user authentication and role-based permissions. It integrates with Sanctum to handle authentication and grants specific permissions, such as "students_management," to control access to student-related functionalities.

2. Student Listing and Filtering: The system allows users to retrieve student records based on various criteria, including department, student number, national number, study year, and current class. It utilizes Laravel's validation rules to validate the request parameters and constructs a query to fetch the relevant student data. The results are presented as a collection of Student Resources.

3. Student Creation and Update: Users can create new student profiles by providing necessary information such as name, contact details, department, and other relevant data. The system validates the input using Laravel's validation rules and saves the student details to the database. Existing student records can also be updated using similar validation and update mechanisms.

4. Department Management: The system supports the management of departments within the educational institution. It associates students with their respective departments using the "department_id" field. Departments can be created, modified, and deleted as required, ensuring accurate categorization and organization of student data.

5. Student Resource and JSON Response: The system utilizes the Student Resource class to format student data into a consistent and structured format. Student records are returned as JSON responses, making it easier to consume and process the data in various client applications.

6. Docker Integration: The system includes a tutorial on obtaining a Docker container's IP address from the host machine. This guide assists developers in leveraging Docker commands and inspecting container network settings, contributing to a seamless integration and deployment process.

7. NestJS Validation: The system provides a tutorial on validating nested objects using the Class Validator library within a NestJS environment. This feature enables the validation of complex data structures and ensures data integrity when handling incoming data.

8. GraphQL Default Values: A tutorial explains how to set default values for input arguments in GraphQL. This feature allows certain fields or arguments to have predefined values if not explicitly provided, enhancing the flexibility and reliability of data queries.

9. NVM for Node.js Version Management: The system includes a guide on using NVM (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions. This helps developers set the default Node.js version for their projects, ensuring compatibility and providing a seamless development experience.

10. Algorithm and Code-related Articles: The system covers various algorithm-related topics, such as choosing the best algorithm for overriding GetHashCode, installing specific versions of Ruby gems, and understanding "Big O" notation. These articles provide valuable insights into algorithmic efficiency, code optimization, and best practices in different programming languages.

11. React Component Development: The system includes tutorials on developing React components, such as a Wordle game using ReactJS and adding multiple classes to a component. These resources aid developers in building interactive and visually appealing user interfaces using React.

12. Documentation: The project emphasizes the importance of documentation, specifically the README.md file. It provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and using the project, showcasing its features, and assisting developers in understanding the codebase and its dependencies.

By combining these features, tutorials, and documentation, the Advanced Student Management System offers a powerful and user-friendly solution for educational institutions to efficiently manage student data, streamline administrative tasks, and foster effective communication within the institution. The project demonstrates proficiency in PHP (utilizing Laravel), Docker, NestJS, GraphQL, Node.js, algorithms, Ruby, and React, showcasing a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of modern web development technologies.

### **authentication**

1-Using Api routes: 

routes\api.php:

```php
Route::post('login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
```

app\Http\Controllers\Api\AuthController.php:

The constructor, this function is part of a controller class and is responsible for setting up themiddleware for authentication using Laravel Sanctum.
This middleware ensures that the user is authenticated using the Sanctum authentication guardbefore accessing the methods.
The $this->middleware('auth:sanctum')->only(['logout', 'user']); line specifies that the'auth:sanctum' middleware should be applied only to the 'logout' and 'user' methods.

```php
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth:sanctum')->only(['logout', 'user']);
    }
```

The login() function, It  validates the incoming request data, including the username, password, and remember option. If the  authentication attempt is successful, it generates an access token using Laravel Sanctum and returns a JSON response with the authentication user "Auth::user()" details, remember token (if applicable), and the access token. If the  authentication attempt fails, it returns a JSON response indicating the error.

The Auth::attempt() method at line 78 is attempting to authenticate the user using the provided username and password.
The method takes an array of credential key-value pairs as its argument, where the keys represent the user attributes ('username', 'password') and the values correspond to the provided input values from the request object. 

The 'user' key in the JSON response refers to the $user object, which is serialized using the [UserResource] (#userResource) class. This enables customized formatting of user attributes, which I defined within the class, ensuring their inclusion in the JSON response.

The createToken() method generates a token for the authenticated user using Laravel Sanctum authentication. The plainTextToken property is then accessed on the generated token, which retrieves the plain text representation of the token

```php
    public function login(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'username' => 'required',
            'password' => ['required', 'min:6'],
            'remember' => ['boolean'],
        ]);

        if (Auth::attempt(['username' => $request->username, 'password' => $request->password])) {
            $user = to_user(Auth::user());
            $token = $user->createToken('Sanctum', [])->plainTextToken;
            if ($request->remember && !$user->remember_token) {
                $user->remember_token = Str::random(40);
                $user->save();
            }
            return response()->json([
                'user' => new UserResource($user),
                'remember_token' => $user->remember_token,
                'token' => $token,
            ], 200);
        }

        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'username or password is incorrect.',
            'errors' => [
                'username' => ['username or password is incorrect.']
            ]
        ], 422);
    }
```
1-Using Api routes: 

routes\web.php:

```php
Route::get('observer/login', [ObserversAuthController::class, 'login'])->name('observer.login');
Route::post('observer/login', [ObserversAuthController::class, 'do_login'])->name('login');
Route::post('observer/logout', [ObserversAuthController::class, 'logout'])->name('observer.logout');
Route::get('user/login', [AuthController::class, 'login'])->name('user.login');
Route::post('user/login', [AuthController::class, 'do_login'])->name('user');
Route::post('user/logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout'])->name('user.logout');
```
app\Http\Controllers\ObserversAuthController.php:

The constructor, it sets up two middleware groups for specific controller methods.
These middleware configurations control the access privileges for different methods in the controller, allowing only guest users to use login-related methods and authenticated users with the'observer' role to access the logout method

```php
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('ob_guest')->only('login','do_login');
        $this->middleware('ob_auth:observer')->only('logout');
    }
```

The login() function handles the logic for the login process in the context of observers.
First, it checks if there is already an authenticated observer user using the Auth::guard('observer')->user() method. If an observer user is already logged in, the function redirects them to the 'observer.home' route.
If there is no authenticated observer user, the function retrieves a collection of observers from the database, ordered by their names, using the orderBy query. This collection of observers is then passed to the 'observers.login' view.

```php
    public function login()
    {
        $observer = Auth::guard('observer')->user();
        if($observer)
            return redirect()->route('observer.home');
        $observers = Observer::orderBy('name')->get();
        return view('observers.login')->with("observers",$observers);
    }
```

The do_login() function handles the submission of the login form for observers.

The Hash::check() function is a method used to compare a plain text password with a hashed password. It takes two arguments: the plain text password ($request->password) and the hashed password($observer->password).
If the provided password does not match the stored password for the observer, it returns back to the login form with an error message indicating that the password is incorrect.

If the provided credentials are valid, the observer is logged in using the Auth::guard('observer')->login($observer) method, and the user is redirected to the 'observer.home' route.

```php
    public function do_login(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'observer_id'       => ['required', 'exists:observers,id'],
            'password'          => ['required', 'string']
        ]);

        $observer = Observer::where('id', $request->observer_id)->first();

        if (!$observer->password) {
            return back()->withInput()->with('error',"المعلومات الشخصية للمراقب غير كاملة.\n يرجى إرسال صورة لوجهي الهوية الشخصية مع القسم والتوصيف الوظيفي والمرتبة العلمية على رقم واتساب التالي: <a href='https://wa.me/0985415539' target='_blank'>0985415539</a>");
        }

        if (!Hash::check($request->password, $observer->password)) {
            return back()->withInput()->with('error',' كلمة المرور غير صحيحة');
        }

        Auth::guard('observer')->login($observer);
        return redirect()->route('observer.home');
    }
```

app\Http\Controllers\AuthController.php:

This constructor sets up middleware groups to manage access privileges for specific controller methods. In this case, the 'ob_guest' middleware allows only guest users to access the 'login' and 'do_login' methods. On the other hand, the 'ob_auth:user' middleware only permits authenticated users with the 'user' role to access the 'logout' method.

```php
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('ob_guest')->only('login','do_login');
        $this->middleware('ob_auth:user')->only('logout');
    }
```

The logout() function handles the logout process for users.

First, it calls the Auth::guard('user')->logout() method to log out the currently authenticated user from the 'user' guard. This effectively clears the user's authentication status and removes the associated token.

After logging out the user, the function redirects them to the 'home' route using redirect()->route('home').

```php
    public function logout()
    {
        Auth::guard('user')->logout();
        return redirect()->route('home');
    }
```

### **PermissionSeeder**

database\seeders\PermissionSeeder.php:

```php
class PermissionSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        $permissions  = Permission::all()->pluck('name')->toArray();
        if(!in_array('users_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'users_management']);
        if(!in_array('permissions_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'permissions_management']);
        if(!in_array('departments_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'departments_management']);
        if(!in_array('positions_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'positions_management']);
        if(!in_array('observers_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'observers_management']);
        if(!in_array('note_templates_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'note_templates_management']);
        if(!in_array('desire_types_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'desire_types_management']);
        if(!in_array('desires_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'desires_management']);
        if(!in_array('exam_days_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'exam_days_management']);
        if(!in_array('collages_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'collages_management']);
        if(!in_array('halls_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'halls_management']);
        if(!in_array('materials_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'materials_management']);             
        if(!in_array('observations_management', $permissions))
            Permission::create(['name' => 'observations_management']);             

        $roles  = Role::all()->pluck('name')->toArray();
        if(!in_array('super_admin', $roles))
            $super_admin_role = Role::create(['name' => 'super_admin']);
        else
            $super_admin_role = Role::where('name', 'super_admin')->first();
        
        if(!in_array('admin', $roles))
            $admin_role = Role::create(['name' => 'admin']);
        else
            $admin_role = Role::where('name', 'admin')->first();
        
        $super_admin_user = User::where('username','super_admin')->first();
        if($super_admin_user)
            $super_admin_user->assignRole($super_admin_role);
        
        $admin_user = User::where('username','admin')->first();
        if($admin_user)
            $admin_user->assignRole($admin_role);
        
        $permissions = Permission::all();
        foreach($permissions as $permission)
            $super_admin_role->givePermissionTo($permission);
    }
}
```
This seeder class is responsible for populating the database with initial permission and role data.
This seeder creates or retrieves specific permissions and roles, assigns roles to users, and gives the *'super_admin'* role permission to all existing permissions in the system.It typically used to seed the initial data in the database for permissions and roles.
### description code lines: 

It retrieves all existing permissions from the Permission model and stores their names in an array using the *pluck* method.
It checks if a every permission (I included in each if statement) exists in the array of permissions. If not, it creates a new permission with the name *'users_management'* using the *create* method of the Permission model.
It repeats the above step for each of the following permissions: 'permissions_management', 'departments_management', 'positions_management', 'observers_management', 'note_templates_management', 'desire_types_management', 'desires_management', 'exam_days_management', 'collages_management', 'halls_management', 'materials_management', and 'observations_management'.

It retrieves all existing roles from the Role model and stores their names in an array using the *pluck* method.
It checks if a role named *'super_admin'* exists in the array of roles. If not, it creates a new role with the name *'super_admin'* using the create method of the Role model. If the role already exists, it retrieves the existing role using the where method.
It repeats the above step for a role named *'admin'*.
It retrieves the user with the username *'super_admin'* using the User model.
If the super admin user exists, it assigns the *'super_admin'* role to the user using the *assignRole method*.

It retrieves the user with the username *'admin'* using the User model.
If the admin user exists, it assigns the *'admin'* role to the user using the assignRole method.
It retrieves all permissions from the Permission model.
It iterates over each permission and gives the *'super_admin'* role permission to each permission using the *givePermissionTo* method.

### **role-permission**

app\Http\Controllers\PermissionsController.php:

```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->middleware('auth:sanctum');
    $this->middleware('can:permissions_management');
}
.
.
public function add_role_permission(Role $role, Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'name' => ['required', 'exists:permissions,name'],
    ]);
    $role->givePermissionTo($request->name);
    return PermissionResource::collection($role->permissions);
}
```
The *add_role_permission* method adds a permission to a specified role and returns a collection of permissions using a resource class for formatting.

### description code lines: 
The constructor method applies two middleware to the class,
 - auth:sanctum 
 - can:permissions_management.
  
auth:sanctum: This middleware is responsible for authenticating the user using Sanctum. (Sanctum is the Laravel package I used that provides a simple, lightweight authentication system for APIs. It allows users to authenticate using API tokens).

can:permissions_management: This middleware checks if the authenticated user has the necessary permission (permissions_management) to access the corresponding route or method.

add_role_permission() method:
The method starts by validating the incoming request data using the validate method. It checks if the name field is required and exists in the permissions table with the *name* column.

If the validation passes, the method calls the *givePermissionTo* method on the *$role* object. This method is provided by a package. It assigns the specified permission *($request->name)* to the role.

Finally, the method returns a collection of *PermissionResource* objects. It appears that the PermissionResource is a resource class used to transform and format the permissions associated with the role.

### **user-permissions**

app\Http\Controllers\Api\UsersController.php:

```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->middleware('auth:sanctum');
    $this->middleware('can:users_management');
}
.
.
.
public function get_users_permissions(User $user)
{
    $roles_ids = $user->roles->pluck('id');
    $permissions_ids = DB::table('role_has_permissions')->whereIn('role_id',$roles_ids)->get()->unique('permission_id')->pluck('permission_id');
    $permissions = Permission::whereIn('id',$permissions_ids)->get();
    return PermissionResource::collection($permissions);
}
```
The *get_users_permissions* method retrieves the roles associated with a user, fetches the unique permission IDs from the roles, retrieves the corresponding permissions, and returns them as a collection of formatted PermissionResource objects.

### **add-teacher**

app\Http\Controllers\Api\MaterialsController.php:

```php
public function add_teacher(Material $material, Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'observer_id'   => ['required', 'exists:observers,id'],
    ]);
    $material->teachers()->attach($request->observer_id);
    return $material->teachers()->pluck('name');
}
```
the *add_teacher* method validates and associates an observer with a material. It then retrieves and returns the names of all the teachers associated with the material. The code is used to manage the relationship between materials and teachers, allowing materials to have multiple teachers.

The *teachers* method defines the relationship between the Material model and the Observer model using a many-to-many relationship. It uses the belongsToMany method and specifies the Observer model class, the pivot table name *(material_teachers)*, and the foreign key columns (material_id and teacher_id) in the pivot table.

```php
public function teachers()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Observer::class, 'material_teachers', 'material_id', 'teacher_id');
}
```
```php
Schema::create('material_teachers', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('material_id')->constrained('materials');
    $table->foreignId('teacher_id')->constrained('observers');
    $table->unique(['material_id','teacher_id']);
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

### **store-observation**

app\Http\Controllers\Api\ObservationsController.php:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'exam_day_id'   => ['required', 'exists:exam_days,id'],
        'exam_period'   => ['required', 'in:1,2,3'],
        'hall_id'       => ['required', 'exists:halls,id'],
        'observer_id'   => ['required', ValidationRule::exists('observers', 'id')->where('ob_active', True)],
        'force'         => ['boolean'],
    ]);

    $exam_day = ExamDay::find($request->exam_day_id);
    $periods = $exam_day->periods_count;
    $rule = 'in:1' . ($periods >= 2 ? ',2' : '') . ($periods >= 3 ? ',3' : '');
    $request->validate([
        'exam_period'   => [$rule],
    ]);

    $observer = Observer::find($request->observer_id);

    if ($observer->ob_remain <= 0 && !$request->force)
        throw new BadRequestException("The selected observer have full observations!");

    $observation = Observation::create([
        'exam_day_id' => $request->exam_day_id,
        'exam_period' => $request->exam_period,
        'hall_id'     => $request->hall_id,
        'observer_id' => $request->observer_id,
    ]);

    $observer->update([
        'ob_finished' => DB::raw('ob_finished + 1'),
        'ob_remain'   => DB::raw('ob_remain - 1'),
    ]);

    return response()->json(new ObservationResource($observation), 201);
}
```
The *store* method validates the request data, creates a new observation, updates the observer's observation-related attributes, and returns the created observation as a JSON response. It also performs additional checks to ensure that the operation is allowed based on the observer's remaining observations and the force parameter.

The code retrieves the associated ExamDay instance based on the provided exam_day_id using the find method.

It constructs a validation rule string ($rule) for the exam_period field based on the number of periods available for the exam day.

The code checks if the selected observer has remaining observations, and if so, creates a new Observation instance, updates the observer's attributes, and returns the created observation, It uses the [ObservationResource class](#ObservationResource) to transform the observation data

### **ObservationResource**

app\Http\Resources\ObservationResource.php:

```php
class ObservationResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray($request)
    {
        return [
            'id'              => $this->id,
            'exam_day_id'     => $this->exam_day_id,
            'hall_id'         => $this->hall_id,
            'observer_id'     => $this->observer_id,
            'exam_period'     => $this->exam_period,
            'exam_day'        => [
                'id'          => $this->exam_day->id,
                'date'        => $this->exam_day->date,
            ],
            'hall'            => [
                'id'          => $this->hall->id,
                'name'        => $this->hall->name,
                'collage'     => new CollageResource($this->hall->collage),
            ],
            'observer'        => [
                'id'          => $this->observer->id,
                'name'        => $this->observer->name,
                'rank'        => $this->observer->rank,
                'ob_type'     => $this->observer->ob_type,
                'ob_count'    => $this->observer->ob_count,
                'ob_remain'   => $this->observer->ob_remain,
                'ob_finished' => $this->observer->ob_finished,
            ],
        ]; 
    }
}
```

The *opened_halls* function retrieves information about opened halls for exams, organizes the data by exam days and periods, and returns the sorted results in an array format. This structured representation allows for efficient handling and retrieval of the opened hall information.

The function retrieves all instances of the OpenedHall model from the database, along with their associated hall and exam_day relationships.

It processes each opened hall by iterating over the $opened_halls collection using a foreach loop.
Exam day ID and exam period values are extracted from each opened hall and casted to integers for consistency.

The function organizes the data by creating entries in the $results array, grouping halls by exam days and periods.

The processed data is sorted based on exam day ID and periods, ensuring an organized representation of the opened halls.

Finally, the function returns the sorted and structured $results array, providing information about opened halls grouped by exam days and periods.

### **students**

app\Http\Controllers\Api\StudentController.php:

```php
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'department_id'   => ['exists:departments,id'],
        'student_number'  => ['string'],
        'national_number' => ['string'],
        'study_year'      => ['string'],
        'current_class'   => ['in:1,2,3,4,5'],
    ]);

    $q = Student::query();
    if($request->department_id)
        $q->where('department_id',$request->department_id);
    
    if($request->student_number)
        $q->where('student_number',$request->student_number);
        
    if($request->national_number)
        $q->where('national_number',$request->national_number);
        
    if($request->study_year)
        $q->where('study_year',$request->study_year);
        
    if($request->current_class)
        $q->where('current_class',$request->current_class);
        
    $students = $q->get();
    return StudentResource::collection($students);    
}
```
The *index* function handles the search functionality for retrieving students based on various criteria provided in the request. It applies the specified filters to the database query, retrieves the matching students, and returns them as a collection of transformed resources.

The index function validates the request parameters to ensure they meet the specified rules. It then creates a query builder instance for the Student model to build dynamic queries.

The function applies filters based on provided parameters such as department_id, student_number, national_number, study_year, and current_class. 

It executes the query and stores the resulting collection of matching students.

Finally, the function transforms the student objects into a resource representation using the StudentResource class and returns the transformed collection as a JSON response.
